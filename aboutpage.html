        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><br>I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree
            in Computer Science and Engineering from Sambhram 
            Institute of Technology, affiliated with Visvesvaraya 
            Technological University. I achieved a CGPA of 7.33
            during my academic journey.<br> <br>I am highly passionate
            about various aspects of the tech world, with a 
            strong focus on software development, cybersecurity,
            SQL development, and web development.<br>
            <br>During my educational journey, I had 
            the opportunity to gain practical experience 
            through internships. I spent approximately two months 
            as an intern in Python web development at Zetacoding 
            and another one-month internship in web development at
            Codsoft. These experiences allowed me to apply my knowledge
            and develop real-world skills in these fields.<br>
            <br>Beyond the tech sphere, I am also an accomplished
            classical dancer in the Bharatanatyam style, with 
            a decade of experience in this art form. My dedication 
            to dance showcases my commitment and discipline
            in various aspects of life.<br>
            <br>In my free time, I have a diverse 
            set of hobbies that include cooking,
            enjoying good food, dancing (of course), 
            and reading books. These activities keep me
            engaged and help me maintain a balanced life.<br>
            <br>My family consists of my hardworking dad, 
            who is an auto driver, and my mom, who is a homemaker
            .I also have a younger brother who is currently 
            pursuing his education in pre-university.<br>
            <br>Lastly, I share my home with two beloved pet 
            dogs named Charlie and Puppy, who 
            bring joy and companionship to my life.<br></p>
